## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores equilibrium behavior in economic and engineering systems, focusing on two main components:

- **Static Equilibrium Solver:**  
  Computes equilibrium points using analytical methods and KKT conditions.

- **Game-Theoretic Simulator:**  
  Models multi-agent competition and simulates Nash equilibria based on a known forward model.
