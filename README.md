## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores equilibrium behavior in economic and engineering systems, focusing on two main components:

- **Static Equilibrium Solver:**  
  Computes equilibrium points using analytical methods and KKT conditions.

- **Game-Theoretic Simulator:**  
  Models multi-agent competition and simulates Nash equilibria based on a known forward model.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Model and compute static equilibria analytically  
- Apply KKT conditions for equilibrium verification  
- Simulate game-theoretic interactions and Nash equilibrium  
- Validate models using known analytic solutions

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (`SymPy`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`)
- MATLAB (optional for prototyping)
- GitHub (version control and documentation)
